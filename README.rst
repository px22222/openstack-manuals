Building
========

Various manuals are in subdirectories of the ``doc/`` directory.

Guides
------

Some pre-requisites are needed to build the guides. If you are using a Linux
operating system you can generate a report of missing local requirements with
the ``bindep`` command::

    $ tox -e bindep

All guides are in the RST format. You can use ``tox`` to prepare
virtual environment and build all guides (HTML only):

    $ tox -e docs

You can also build a specific guide.

For example, to build *OpenStack End User Guide*, use the following command::

    $ tox -e build -- user-guide

You can find the root of the generated HTML documentation at::

    doc/user-guide/build/html/index.html

To build a specific guide with a PDF file, add a ``-pdf`` option like::

    $ tox -e build -- user-guide --pdf

The generated PDF file will be copied to the root directory of the
generated HTML documentation.

If you get this message `make: xelatex: No such file or directory` it means
your local environment does not have LaTeX installed. Read `Getting LaTeX
 <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>`_ for instructions.

Testing of changes and building of the manual
=============================================

Install the Python tox package and run ``tox`` from the top-level
directory to use the same tests that are done as part of the OpenStack
CI jobs.

If you like to run individual tests, run:

 * ``tox -e checkbuild`` - to actually build the manual
 * ``tox -e checklang`` - to build translated manuals
 * ``tox -e checkniceness`` - to run the niceness tests
 * ``tox -e linkcheck`` - to run the tests for working remote URLs

The :command:`tox` command uses the openstack-doc-tools package to run the
tests.
