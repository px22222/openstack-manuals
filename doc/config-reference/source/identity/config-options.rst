Domain-specific Identity drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Identity service supports domain-specific Identity drivers
installed on an SQL or LDAP back end, and supports domain-specific
Identity configuration options, which are stored in domain-specific
configuration files. See the
`Admin guide Identity Management Chapter
<https://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/identity-domain-specific-config.html>`_
for more information.
