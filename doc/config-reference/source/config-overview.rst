OpenStack is a collection of open source project components
that enable setting up cloud services. Each component uses similar
configuration techniques and a common framework for INI file options.

This guide pulls together multiple references and configuration
options for the following OpenStack components:

* Bare Metal service
* Block Storage service
* Compute service
* Dashboard
* Database service
* Data Processing service
* Identity service
* Image service
* Message service
* Networking service
* Object Storage service
* Orchestration service
* Shared File Systems service
* Telemetry service

Also, OpenStack uses many shared service and libraries,
such as database connections and RPC messaging,
whose configuration options are described at :doc:`common-configurations`.
