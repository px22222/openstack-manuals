managing groups of homogeneous objects exposed by other OpenStack services.
The configuration file for this service is ``/etc/senlin/senlin.conf``.

.. note::

   The common configurations for shared services and libraries,
   such as database connections and RPC messaging,
   are described at :doc:`common-configurations`.
