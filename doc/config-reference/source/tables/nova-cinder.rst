.. list-table:: Description of cinder configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``certfile`` = ``None``

     - (String) PEM encoded client certificate cert file

   * - ``catalog_info`` = ``volumev2:cinderv2:publicURL``

     - (String) Info to match when looking for cinder in the service catalog.

       Possible values:

       * Format is separated values of the form: <service_type>:<service_name>:<endpoint_type>

       Note: Nova does not support the Cinder v1 API since the Nova 15.0.0 Ocata release.

       Related options:

       * endpoint_template - Setting this option will override catalog_info

   * - ``cross_az_attach`` = ``True``

     - (Boolean) Allow attach between instance and volume in different availability zones.

       If False, volumes attached to an instance must be in the same availability zone in Cinder as the instance availability zone in Nova. This also means care should be taken when booting an instance from a volume where source is not "volume" because Nova will attempt to create a volume using the same availability zone as what is assigned to the instance. If that AZ is not in Cinder (or allow_availability_zone_fallback=False in cinder.conf), the volume create request will fail and the instance will fail the build request. By default there is no availability zone restriction on volume attach.

   * - ``insecure`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Verify HTTPS connections.

   * - ``http_retries`` = ``3``

     - (Integer) Number of times cinderclient should retry on any failed http call. 0 means connection is attempted only once. Setting it to any positive integer means that on failure connection is retried that many times e.g. setting it to 3 means total attempts to connect will be 4.

       Possible values:

       * Any integer value. 0 means connection is attempted only once

   * - ``endpoint_template`` = ``None``

     - (String) If this option is set then it will override service catalog lookup with this template for cinder endpoint

       Possible values:

       * URL for cinder endpoint API e.g. http://localhost:8776/v2/%(project_id)s

       Note: Nova does not support the Cinder v1 API since the Nova 15.0.0 Ocata release.

       Related options:

       * catalog_info - If endpoint_template is not set, catalog_info will be used.

   * - ``timeout`` = ``None``

     - (Integer) Timeout value for http requests

   * - ``os_region_name`` = ``None``

     - (String) Region name of this node. This is used when picking the URL in the service catalog.

       Possible values:

       * Any string representing region name

   * - ``cafile`` = ``None``

     - (String) PEM encoded Certificate Authority to use when verifying HTTPs connections.

   * - ``keyfile`` = ``None``

     - (String) PEM encoded client certificate key file
