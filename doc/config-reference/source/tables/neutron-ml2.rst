.. list-table:: Description of ML2 configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[ml2]**
     -
   * - ``extension_drivers`` =
     - (List) An ordered list of extension driver entrypoints to be loaded from the neutron.ml2.extension_drivers namespace. For example: extension_drivers = port_security,qos
   * - ``external_network_type`` = ``None``
     - (String) Default network type for external networks when no provider attributes are specified. By default it is None, which means that if provider attributes are not specified while creating external networks then they will have the same type as tenant networks. Allowed values for external_network_type config option depend on the network type values configured in type_drivers config option.
   * - ``mechanism_drivers`` =
     - (List) An ordered list of networking mechanism driver entrypoints to be loaded from the neutron.ml2.mechanism_drivers namespace.
   * - ``overlay_ip_version`` = ``4``
     - (Integer) IP version of all overlay (tunnel) network endpoints. Use a value of 4 for IPv4 or 6 for IPv6.
   * - ``path_mtu`` = ``0``
     - (Integer) Maximum size of an IP packet (MTU) that can traverse the underlying physical network infrastructure without fragmentation when using an overlay/tunnel protocol. This option allows specifying a physical network MTU value that differs from the default global_physnet_mtu value.
   * - ``physical_network_mtus`` =
     - (List) A list of mappings of physical networks to MTU values. The format of the mapping is <physnet>:<mtu val>. This mapping allows specifying a physical network MTU value that differs from the default global_physnet_mtu value.
   * - ``tenant_network_types`` = ``local``
     - (List) Ordered list of network_types to allocate as tenant networks. The default value 'local' is useful for single-box testing but provides no connectivity between hosts.
   * - ``type_drivers`` = ``local, flat, vlan, gre, vxlan, geneve``
     - (List) List of network type driver entrypoints to be loaded from the neutron.ml2.type_drivers namespace.
