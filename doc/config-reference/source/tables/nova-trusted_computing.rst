.. list-table:: Description of trusted_computing configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``attestation_auth_timeout`` = ``60``

     - (Integer) This value controls how long a successful attestation is cached. Once this period has elapsed, a new attestation request will be made. See the `attestation_server` help text for more information about host verification.

       This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use a different scheduler, this option has no effect. Also note that this setting only affects scheduling if the 'TrustedFilter' filter is enabled.

       Possible values:

       * A integer value, corresponding to the timeout interval for attestations in seconds. Any integer is valid, although setting this to zero or negative values can greatly impact performance when using an attestation service.

       * attestation_server

       * attestation_server_ca_file

       * attestation_port

       * attestation_api_url

       * attestation_auth_blob

       * attestation_insecure_ssl

   * - ``attestation_port`` = ``8443``

     - (Port number) The port to use when connecting to the attestation server. See the `attestation_server` help text for more information about host verification.

       This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use a different scheduler, this option has no effect. Also note that this setting only affects scheduling if the 'TrustedFilter' filter is enabled.

       * attestation_auth_timeout

       * attestation_insecure_ssl

   * - ``attestation_api_url`` = ``/OpenAttestationWebServices/V1.0``

     - (String) The URL on the attestation server to use. See the `attestation_server` help text for more information about host verification.

       This value must be just that path portion of the full URL, as it will be joined to the host specified in the attestation_server option.

       This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use a different scheduler, this option has no effect. Also note that this setting only affects scheduling if the 'TrustedFilter' filter is enabled.

       Possible values:

       * A valid URL string of the attestation server, or an empty string.

       * attestation_insecure_ssl

   * - ``attestation_server`` = ``None``

     - (String) The host to use as the attestation server.

       Cloud computing pools can involve thousands of compute nodes located at different geographical locations, making it difficult for cloud providers to identify a node's trustworthiness. When using the Trusted filter, users can request that their VMs only be placed on nodes that have been verified by the attestation server specified in this option.

       This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use a different scheduler, this option has no effect. Also note that this setting only affects scheduling if the 'TrustedFilter' filter is enabled.

       Possible values:

       * A string representing the host name or IP address of the attestation server, or an empty string.

       Related options:

       * attestation_server_ca_file

       * attestation_port

       * attestation_api_url

       * attestation_auth_blob

       * attestation_auth_timeout

       * attestation_insecure_ssl

   * - ``attestation_insecure_ssl`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) When set to True, the SSL certificate verification is skipped for the attestation service. See the `attestation_server` help text for more information about host verification.

       This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use a different scheduler, this option has no effect. Also note that this setting only affects scheduling if the 'TrustedFilter' filter is enabled.

       * attestation_auth_blob

       * attestation_auth_timeout

   * - ``attestation_auth_blob`` = ``None``

     - (String) Attestation servers require a specific blob that is used to authenticate. The content and format of the blob are determined by the particular attestation server being used. There is no default value; you must supply the value as specified by your attestation service. See the `attestation_server` help text for more information about host verification.

       This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use a different scheduler, this option has no effect. Also note that this setting only affects scheduling if the 'TrustedFilter' filter is enabled.

       Possible values:

       * A string containing the specific blob required by the attestation server, or an empty string.

   * - ``attestation_server_ca_file`` = ``None``

     - (String) The absolute path to the certificate to use for authentication when connecting to the attestation server. See the `attestation_server` help text for more information about host verification.

       This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use a different scheduler, this option has no effect. Also note that this setting only affects scheduling if the 'TrustedFilter' filter is enabled.
