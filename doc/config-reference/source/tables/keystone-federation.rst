.. list-table:: Description of federation configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[federation]**
     -
   * - ``driver`` = ``sql``
     - (String) Entry point for the federation backend driver in the `keystone.federation` namespace. Keystone only provides a `sql` driver, so there is no reason to set this option unless you are providing a custom entry point.
   * - ``assertion_prefix`` =
     - (String) Prefix to use when filtering environment variable names for federated assertions. Matched variables are passed into the federated mapping engine.
   * - ``remote_id_attribute`` = ``None``
     - (String) Value to be used to obtain the entity ID of the Identity Provider from the environment. For `mod_shib`, this would be `Shib-Identity-Provider`. For For `mod_auth_openidc`, this could be `HTTP_OIDC_ISS`. For `mod_auth_mellon`, this could be `MELLON_IDP`.
   * - ``federated_domain_name`` = ``Federated``
     - (String) An arbitrary domain name that is reserved to allow federated ephemeral users to have a domain concept. Note that an admin will not be able to create a domain with this name or update an existing domain to this name. You are not advised to change this value unless you really have to.
   * - ``trusted_dashboard`` = ``[]``
     - (Multi-valued) A list of trusted dashboard hosts. Before accepting a Single Sign-On request to return a token, the origin host must be a member of this list. This configuration option may be repeated for multiple values. You must set this in order to use web-based SSO flows. For example: trusted_dashboard=https://acme.example.com/auth/websso trusted_dashboard=https://beta.example.com/auth/websso
   * - ``sso_callback_template`` = ``/etc/keystone/sso_callback_template.html``
     - (String) Absolute path to an HTML file used as a Single Sign-On callback handler. This page is expected to redirect the user from keystone back to a trusted dashboard host, by form encoding a token in a POST request. Keystone's default value should be sufficient for most deployments.
   * - ``caching`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Toggle for federation caching. This has no effect unless global caching is enabled. There is typically no reason to disable this.
