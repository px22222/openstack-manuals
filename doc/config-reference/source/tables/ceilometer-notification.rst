.. list-table:: Description of notification configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[notification]**
     -
   * - ``batch_size`` = ``100``
     - (Integer) Number of notification messages to wait before publishing them. Batching is advised when transformations areapplied in pipeline.
   * - ``batch_timeout`` = ``5``
     - (Integer) Number of seconds to wait before publishing sampleswhen batch_size is not reached (None means indefinitely)
   * - ``disable_non_metric_meters`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) WARNING: Ceilometer historically offered the ability to store events as meters. This usage is NOT advised as it can flood the metering database and cause performance degradation.
   * - ``messaging_urls`` = ``[]``
     - (Multi-valued) Messaging URLs to listen for notifications. Example: rabbit://user:pass@host1:port1[,user:pass@hostN:portN]/virtual_host (DEFAULT/transport_url is used if empty). This is useful when you have dedicate messaging nodes for each service, for example, all nova notifications go to rabbit-nova:5672, while all cinder notifications go to rabbit-cinder:5672.
   * - ``pipeline_processing_queues`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) Number of queues to parallelize workload across. This value should be larger than the number of active notification agents for optimal results. WARNING: Once set, lowering this value may result in lost data.
