.. list-table:: Description of CA and SSL configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[signing]**
     -
   * - ``certfile`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/certs/signing_cert.pem``
     - (String) Absolute path to the public certificate file to use for signing responses to revocation lists requests. Set this together with `[signing] keyfile`. For non-production environments, you may be interested in using `keystone-manage pki_setup` to generate self-signed certificates.

       - **Deprecated**

         `keystone-manage pki_setup` was deprecated in Mitaka and removed in Pike. These options remain for backwards compatibility.
   * - ``keyfile`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/private/signing_key.pem``
     - (String) Absolute path to the private key file to use for signing responses to revocation lists requests. Set this together with `[signing] certfile`.

       - **Deprecated**

         `keystone-manage pki_setup` was deprecated in Mitaka and removed in Pike. These options remain for backwards compatibility.
   * - ``ca_certs`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/certs/ca.pem``
     - (String) Absolute path to the public certificate authority (CA) file to use when creating self-signed certificates with `keystone-manage pki_setup`. Set this together with `[signing] ca_key`. There is no reason to set this option unless you are requesting revocation lists in a non-production environment. Use a `[signing] certfile` issued from a trusted certificate authority instead.

       - **Deprecated**

         `keystone-manage pki_setup` was deprecated in Mitaka and removed in Pike. These options remain for backwards compatibility.
   * - ``ca_key`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/private/cakey.pem``
     - (String) Absolute path to the private certificate authority (CA) key file to use when creating self-signed certificates with `keystone-manage pki_setup`. Set this together with `[signing] ca_certs`. There is no reason to set this option unless you are requesting revocation lists in a non-production environment. Use a `[signing] certfile` issued from a trusted certificate authority instead.

       - **Deprecated**

         `keystone-manage pki_setup` was deprecated in Mitaka and removed in Pike. These options remain for backwards compatibility.
   * - ``key_size`` = ``2048``
     - (Integer) Key size (in bits) to use when generating a self-signed token signing certificate. There is no reason to set this option unless you are requesting revocation lists in a non-production environment. Use a `[signing] certfile` issued from a trusted certificate authority instead.

       - **Deprecated**

         `keystone-manage pki_setup` was deprecated in Mitaka and removed in Pike. These options remain for backwards compatibility.
   * - ``valid_days`` = ``3650``
     - (Integer) The validity period (in days) to use when generating a self-signed token signing certificate. There is no reason to set this option unless you are requesting revocation lists in a non-production environment. Use a `[signing] certfile` issued from a trusted certificate authority instead.

       - **Deprecated**

         `keystone-manage pki_setup` was deprecated in Mitaka and removed in Pike. These options remain for backwards compatibility.
   * - ``cert_subject`` = ``/C=US/ST=Unset/L=Unset/O=Unset/CN=www.example.com``
     - (String) The certificate subject to use when generating a self-signed token signing certificate. There is no reason to set this option unless you are requesting revocation lists in a non-production environment. Use a `[signing] certfile` issued from a trusted certificate authority instead.

       - **Deprecated**
