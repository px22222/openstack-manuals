.. list-table:: Description of role configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[role]**
     -
   * - ``driver`` = ``None``
     - (String) Entry point for the role backend driver in the `keystone.role` namespace. Keystone only provides a `sql` driver, so there's no reason to change this unless you are providing a custom entry point.
   * - ``caching`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Toggle for role caching. This has no effect unless global caching is enabled. In a typical deployment, there is no reason to disable this.
   * - ``cache_time`` = ``None``
     - (Integer) Time to cache role data, in seconds. This has no effect unless both global caching and `[role] caching` are enabled.
   * - ``list_limit`` = ``None``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of entities that will be returned in a role collection. This may be useful to tune if you have a large number of discrete roles in your deployment.
