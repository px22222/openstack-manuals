.. list-table:: Description of ephemeral_storage_encryption configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``cipher`` = ``aes-xts-plain64``

     - (String) Cipher-mode string to be used.

       The cipher and mode to be used to encrypt ephemeral storage. The set of cipher-mode combinations available depends on kernel support.

       Possible values:

       * Any crypto option listed in ``/proc/crypto``.

   * - ``enabled`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Enables/disables LVM ephemeral storage encryption.

   * - ``key_size`` = ``512``

     - (Integer) Encryption key length in bits.

       The bit length of the encryption key to be used to encrypt ephemeral storage. In XTS mode only half of the bits are used for encryption key.
