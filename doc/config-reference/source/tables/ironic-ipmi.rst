.. list-table:: Description of IPMI configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[ipmi]**
     -
   * - ``min_command_interval`` = ``5``
     - (Integer) Minimum time, in seconds, between IPMI operations sent to a server. There is a risk with some hardware that setting this too low may cause the BMC to crash. Recommended setting is 5 seconds.
   * - ``retry_timeout`` = ``60``
     - (Integer) Maximum time in seconds to retry IPMI operations. There is a tradeoff when setting this value. Setting this too low may cause older BMCs to crash and require a hard reset. However, setting too high can cause the sync power state periodic task to hang when there are slow or unresponsive BMCs.
