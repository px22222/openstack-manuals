.. list-table:: Description of osapi_v21 configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``project_id_regex`` = ``None``

     - (String) This option is a string representing a regular expression (regex) that matches the project_id as contained in URLs. If not set, it will match normal UUIDs created by keystone.

       Possible values:

       * A string representing any legal regular expression

       - **Deprecated**

         Recent versions of nova constrain project IDs to hexadecimal characters and dashes. If your installation uses IDs outside of this range, you should use this option to provide your own regex and give you time to migrate offending projects to valid IDs before the next release.

   * - ``extensions_blacklist`` =

     - (List) This option is a list of all of the v2.1 API extensions to never load.

       Possible values:

       * A list of strings, each being the alias of an extension that you do not wish to load.

       Related options:

       * enabled

       * extensions_whitelist

       - **Deprecated**

         API extensions are now part of the standard API. API extensions should be disabled using policy, rather than via these configuration options.

   * - ``extensions_whitelist`` =

     - (List) This is a list of extensions. If it is empty, then *all* extensions except those specified in the extensions_blacklist option will be loaded. If it is not empty, then only those extensions in this list will be loaded, provided that they are also not in the extensions_blacklist option.

       Possible values:

       * A list of strings, each being the alias of an extension that you wish to load, or an empty list, which indicates that all extensions are to be run.

       Related options:

       * enabled

       * extensions_blacklist

       - **Deprecated**

         API extensions are now part of the standard API. API extensions should be disabled using policy, rather than via these configuration options.
