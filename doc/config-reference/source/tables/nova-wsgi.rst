.. list-table:: Description of wsgi configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``api_paste_config`` = ``api-paste.ini``

     - (String) This option represents a file name for the paste.deploy config for nova-api.

       Possible values:

       * A string representing file name for the paste.deploy config.

   * - ``default_pool_size`` = ``1000``

     - (Integer) This option specifies the size of the pool of greenthreads used by wsgi. It is possible to limit the number of concurrent connections using this option.

   * - ``keep_alive`` = ``True``

     - (Boolean) This option allows using the same TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new one for every single request/response pair. HTTP keep-alive indicates HTTP connection reuse.

       Possible values:

       * True : reuse HTTP connection.

       * False : closes the client socket connection explicitly.

       Related options:

       * tcp_keepidle

   * - ``secure_proxy_ssl_header`` = ``None``

     - (String) This option specifies the HTTP header used to determine the protocol scheme for the original request, even if it was removed by a SSL terminating proxy.

       Possible values:

       * None (default) - the request scheme is not influenced by any HTTP headers.

       * Valid HTTP header, like HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO

   * - ``client_socket_timeout`` = ``900``

     - (Integer) This option specifies the timeout for client connections' socket operations. If an incoming connection is idle for this number of seconds it will be closed. It indicates timeout on individual read/writes on the socket connection. To wait forever set to 0.

   * - ``ssl_ca_file`` = ``None``

     - (String) This option allows setting path to the CA certificate file that should be used to verify connecting clients.

       Possible values:

       * String representing path to the CA certificate file.

       Related options:

       * enabled_ssl_apis

   * - ``wsgi_log_format`` = ``%(client_ip)s "%(request_line)s" status: %(status_code)s len: %(body_length)s time: %(wall_seconds).7f``

     - (String) It represents a python format string that is used as the template to generate log lines. The following values can be formatted into it: client_ip, date_time, request_line, status_code, body_length, wall_seconds.

       This option is used for building custom request loglines.

       Possible values:

       * '%(client_ip)s "%(request_line)s" status: %(status_code)s' 'len: %(body_length)s time: %(wall_seconds).7f' (default)

       * Any formatted string formed by specific values.

   * - ``tcp_keepidle`` = ``600``

     - (Integer) This option sets the value of TCP_KEEPIDLE in seconds for each server socket. It specifies the duration of time to keep connection active. TCP generates a KEEPALIVE transmission for an application that requests to keep connection active. Not supported on OS X.

       Related options:

       * keep_alive

   * - ``max_header_line`` = ``16384``

     - (Integer) This option specifies the maximum line size of message headers to be accepted. max_header_line may need to be increased when using large tokens (typically those generated by the Keystone v3 API with big service catalogs).

       Since TCP is a stream based protocol, in order to reuse a connection, the HTTP has to have a way to indicate the end of the previous response and beginning of the next. Hence, in a keep_alive case, all messages must have a self-defined message length.

   * - ``ssl_cert_file`` = ``None``

     - (String) This option allows setting path to the SSL certificate of API server.

       Possible values:

       * String representing path to the SSL certificate.

       Related options:

       * enabled_ssl_apis

   * - ``ssl_key_file`` = ``None``

     - (String) This option specifies the path to the file where SSL private key of API server is stored when SSL is in effect.

       Possible values:

       * String representing path to the SSL private key.

       Related options:

       * enabled_ssl_apis
