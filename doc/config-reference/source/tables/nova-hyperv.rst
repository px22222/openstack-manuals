.. list-table:: Description of hyperv configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``config_drive_cdrom`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Configuration drive cdrom

       OpenStack can be configured to write instance metadata to a configuration drive, which is then attached to the instance before it boots. The configuration drive can be attached as a disk drive (default) or as a CD drive.

       Possible values:

       * True: Attach the configuration drive image as a CD drive.

       * False: Attach the configuration drive image as a disk drive (Default).

       Related options:

       * This option is meaningful with force_config_drive option set to 'True' or when the REST API call to create an instance will have '--config-drive=True' flag.

       * config_drive_format option must be set to 'iso9660' in order to use CD drive as the configuration drive image.

       * To use configuration drive with Hyper-V, you must set the mkisofs_cmd value to the full path to an mkisofs.exe installation. Additionally, you must set the qemu_img_cmd value to the full path to an qemu-img command installation.

       * You can configure the Compute service to always create a configuration drive by setting the force_config_drive option to 'True'.

   * - ``instances_path_share`` =

     - (String) Instances path share

       The name of a Windows share mapped to the "instances_path" dir and used by the resize feature to copy files to the target host. If left blank, an administrative share (hidden network share) will be used, looking for the same "instances_path" used locally.

       Possible values:

       * "": An administrative share will be used (Default).

       * Name of a Windows share.

       Related options:

       * "instances_path": The directory which will be used if this option here is left blank.

   * - ``volume_attach_retry_count`` = ``10``

     - (Integer) Volume attach retry count

       The number of times to retry attaching a volume. Volume attachment is retried until success or the given retry count is reached.

       Possible values:

       * Positive integer values (Default: 10).

       Related options:

       * Time interval between attachment attempts is declared with volume_attach_retry_interval option.

   * - ``volume_attach_retry_interval`` = ``5``

     - (Integer) Volume attach retry interval

       Interval between volume attachment attempts, in seconds.

       Possible values:

       * Time in seconds (Default: 5).

       Related options:

       * This options is meaningful when volume_attach_retry_count is greater than 1.

       * The retry loop runs with volume_attach_retry_count and volume_attach_retry_interval configuration options.

   * - ``vswitch_name`` = ``None``

     - (String) External virtual switch name

       The Hyper-V Virtual Switch is a software-based layer-2 Ethernet network switch that is available with the installation of the Hyper-V server role. The switch includes programmatically managed and extensible capabilities to connect virtual machines to both virtual networks and the physical network. In addition, Hyper-V Virtual Switch provides policy enforcement for security, isolation, and service levels. The vSwitch represented by this config option must be an external one (not internal or private).

       Possible values:

       * If not provided, the first of a list of available vswitches is used. This list is queried using WQL.

       * Virtual switch name.

   * - ``qemu_img_cmd`` = ``qemu-img.exe``

     - (String) qemu-img command

       qemu-img is required for some of the image related operations like converting between different image types. You can get it from here: (http://qemu.weilnetz.de/) or you can install the Cloudbase OpenStack Hyper-V Compute Driver (https://cloudbase.it/openstack-hyperv-driver/) which automatically sets the proper path for this config option. You can either give the full path of qemu-img.exe or set its path in the PATH environment variable and leave this option to the default value.

       Possible values:

       * Name of the qemu-img executable, in case it is in the same directory as the nova-compute service or its path is in the PATH environment variable (Default).

       * Path of qemu-img command (DRIVELETTER:\PATH\TO\QEMU-IMG\COMMAND).

       Related options:

       * If the config_drive_cdrom option is False, qemu-img will be used to convert the ISO to a VHD, otherwise the configuration drive will remain an ISO. To use configuration drive with Hyper-V, you must set the mkisofs_cmd value to the full path to an mkisofs.exe installation.

   * - ``power_state_event_polling_interval`` = ``2``

     - (Integer) Power state event polling interval

       Instance power state change event polling frequency. Sets the listener interval for power state events to the given value. This option enhances the internal lifecycle notifications of instances that reboot themselves. It is unlikely that an operator has to change this value.

       Possible values:

       * Time in seconds (Default: 2).

   * - ``enable_remotefx`` = ``False``

     - (Boolean) Enable RemoteFX feature

       This requires at least one DirectX 11 capable graphics adapter for Windows / Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 or newer and RDS-Virtualization feature has to be enabled.

       Instances with RemoteFX can be requested with the following flavor extra specs:

       **os:resolution**. Guest VM screen resolution size. Acceptable values::

        1024x768, 1280x1024, 1600x1200, 1920x1200, 2560x1600, 3840x2160
