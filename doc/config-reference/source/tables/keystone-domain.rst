.. list-table:: Description of domain configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[domain_config]**
     -
   * - ``driver`` = ``sql``
     - (String) Entry point for the domain-specific configuration driver in the `keystone.resource.domain_config` namespace. Only a `sql` option is provided by keystone, so there is no reason to set this unless you are providing a custom entry point.
   * - ``caching`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Toggle for caching of the domain-specific configuration backend. This has no effect unless global caching is enabled. There is normally no reason to disable this.
   * - ``cache_time`` = ``300``
     - (Integer) Time-to-live (TTL, in seconds) to cache domain-specific configuration data. This has no effect unless `[domain_config] caching` is enabled.
