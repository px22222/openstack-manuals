   * - **[oslo_middleware]**
     -
   * - ``enable_proxy_headers_parsing`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Whether the application is behind a proxy or not. This determines if the middleware should parse the headers or not.
   * - ``max_request_body_size`` = ``114688``
     - (Integer) The maximum body size for each request, in bytes.
   * - ``secure_proxy_ssl_header`` = ``X-Forwarded-Proto``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: The HTTP Header that will be used to determine what the original request protocol scheme was, even if it was hidden by a SSL termination proxy.
   * - **[oslo_policy]**
     -
   * - ``policy_default_rule`` = ``default``
     - (String) Default rule. Enforced when a requested rule is not found.
   * - ``policy_dirs`` = ``['policy.d']``
     - (Multi-valued) Directories where policy configuration files are stored. They can be relative to any directory in the search path defined by the config_dir option, or absolute paths. The file defined by policy_file must exist for these directories to be searched. Missing or empty directories are ignored.
   * - ``policy_file`` = ``policy.json``
     - (String) The file that defines policies.
   * - **[revision]**
     -
   * - ``senlin_api_revision`` = ``1.0``

   * - ``max_json_body_size`` = ``1048576``
     - (Integer) Maximum raw byte size of JSON request body. Should be larger than max_template_size.
   * - ``tcp_keepidle`` = ``600``
