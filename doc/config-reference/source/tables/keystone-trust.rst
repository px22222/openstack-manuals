.. list-table:: Description of trust configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[trust]**
     -
   * - ``enabled`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Delegation and impersonation features using trusts can be optionally disabled.
   * - ``allow_redelegation`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Allows authorization to be redelegated from one user to another, effectively chaining trusts together. When disabled, the `remaining_uses` attribute of a trust is constrained to be zero.
   * - ``max_redelegation_count`` = ``3``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of times that authorization can be redelegated from one user to another in a chain of trusts. This number may be reduced further for a specific trust.
   * - ``driver`` = ``sql``
     - (String) Entry point for the trust backend driver in the `keystone.trust` namespace. Keystone only provides a `sql` driver, so there is no reason to change this unless you are providing a custom entry point.
