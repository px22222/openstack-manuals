.. list-table:: Description of Fernet tokens configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[fernet_tokens]**
     -
   * - ``key_repository`` = ``/etc/keystone/fernet-keys/``
     - (String) Directory containing Fernet token keys. This directory must exist before using `keystone-manage fernet_setup` for the first time, must be writable by the user running `keystone-manage fernet_setup` or `keystone-manage fernet_rotate`, and of course must be readable by keystone's server process. The repository may contain keys in one of three states: a single staged key (always index 0) used for token validation, a single primary key (always the highest index) used for token creation and validation, and any number of secondary keys (all other index values) used for token validation. With multiple keystone nodes, each node must share the same key repository contents, with the exception of the staged key (index 0). It is safe to run `keystone-manage fernet_rotate` once on any one node to promote a staged key (index 0) to be the new primary (incremented from the previous highest index), and produce a new staged key (a new key with index 0); the resulting repository can then be atomically replicated to other nodes without any risk of race conditions (for example, it is safe to run `keystone-manage fernet_rotate` on host A, wait any amount of time, create a tarball of the directory on host A, unpack it on host B to a temporary location, and atomically move (`mv`) the directory into place on host B). Running `keystone-manage fernet_rotate` *twice* on a key repository without syncing other nodes will result in tokens that can not be validated by all nodes.
   * - ``max_active_keys`` = ``3``
     - (Integer) This controls how many keys are held in rotation by `keystone-manage fernet_rotate` before they are discarded. The default value of 3 means that keystone will maintain one staged key (always index 0), one primary key (the highest numerical index), and one secondary key (every other index). Increasing this value means that additional secondary keys will be kept in the rotation.
