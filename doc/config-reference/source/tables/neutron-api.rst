   * - ``api_extensions_path`` =
     - (String) The path for API extensions. Note that this can be a colon-separated list of paths. For example: api_extensions_path = extensions:/path/to/more/exts:/even/more/exts. The __path__ of neutron.extensions is appended to this, so if your extensions are in there you don't need to specify them here.
   * - ``api_paste_config`` = ``api-paste.ini``

   * - ``max_header_line`` = ``16384``
     - (Integer) Maximum line size of message headers to be accepted. max_header_line may need to be increased when using large tokens (typically those generated when keystone is configured to use PKI tokens with big service catalogs).
   * - ``pagination_max_limit`` = ``-1``

     - (Integer) Size of the pool of greenthreads used by wsgi
   * - ``wsgi_keep_alive`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) If False, closes the client socket connection explicitly.
   * - ``wsgi_log_format`` = ``%(client_ip)s "%(request_line)s" status: %(status_code)s  len: %(body_length)s time: %(wall_seconds).7f``
     - (String) A python format string that is used as the template to generate log lines. The following values can beformatted into it: client_ip, date_time, request_line, status_code, body_length, wall_seconds.
   * - **[oslo_middleware]**
     -
   * - ``enable_proxy_headers_parsing`` = ``False``

   * - ``secure_proxy_ssl_header`` = ``X-Forwarded-Proto``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: The HTTP Header that will be used to determine what the original request protocol scheme was, even if it was hidden by a SSL termination proxy.
