     - (List) Extra dogpile.cache backend modules to register with the dogpile.cache library.
   * - ``config_prefix`` = ``keystone.kvs``
     - (String) Prefix for building the configuration dictionary for the KVS region. This should not need to be changed unless there is another dogpile.cache region with the same configuration name.
   * - ``default_lock_timeout`` = ``5``
     - (Integer) Default lock timeout (in seconds) for distributed locking.
   * - ``enable_key_mangler`` = ``True``
