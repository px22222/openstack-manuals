.. list-table:: Description of Tokenless Authorization configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[tokenless_auth]**
     -
   * - ``trusted_issuer`` = ``[]``
     - (Multi-valued) The list of distinguished names which identify trusted issuers of client certificates allowed to use X.509 tokenless authorization. If the option is absent then no certificates will be allowed. The format for the values of a distinguished name (DN) must be separated by a comma and contain no spaces. Furthermore, because an individual DN may contain commas, this configuration option may be repeated multiple times to represent multiple values. For example, keystone.conf would include two consecutive lines in order to trust two different DNs, such as `trusted_issuer = CN=john,OU=keystone,O=openstack` and `trusted_issuer = CN=mary,OU=eng,O=abc`.
   * - ``protocol`` = ``x509``
     - (String) The federated protocol ID used to represent X.509 tokenless authorization. This is used in combination with the value of `[tokenless_auth] issuer_attribute` to find a corresponding federated mapping. In a typical deployment, there is no reason to change this value.
   * - ``issuer_attribute`` = ``SSL_CLIENT_I_DN``
     - (String) The name of the WSGI environment variable used to pass the issuer of the client certificate to keystone. This attribute is used as an identity provider ID for the X.509 tokenless authorization along with the protocol to look up its corresponding mapping. In a typical deployment, there is no reason to change this value.
