.. list-table:: Description of revoke configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[revoke]**
     -
   * - ``driver`` = ``sql``
     - (String) Entry point for the token revocation backend driver in the `keystone.revoke` namespace. Keystone only provides a `sql` driver, so there is no reason to set this option unless you are providing a custom entry point.
   * - ``expiration_buffer`` = ``1800``
     - (Integer) The number of seconds after a token has expired before a corresponding revocation event may be purged from the backend.
   * - ``caching`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Toggle for revocation event caching. This has no effect unless global caching is enabled.
   * - ``cache_time`` = ``3600``
     - (Integer) Time to cache the revocation list and the revocation events (in seconds). This has no effect unless global and `[revoke] caching` are both enabled.
