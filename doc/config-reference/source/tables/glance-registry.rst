     - (String) DEPRECATED: The region for the authentication service. If "use_user_token" is not in effect and using keystone auth, then region name can be specified. This option was considered harmful and has been deprecated in M release. It will be removed in O release. For more information read OSSN-0060. Related functionality with uploading big images has been implemented with Keystone trusts support.
   * - ``auth_strategy`` = ``noauth``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: The strategy to use for authentication. If "use_user_token" is not in effect, then auth strategy can be specified. This option was considered harmful and has been deprecated in M release. It will be removed in O release. For more information read OSSN-0060.

   * - ``registry_client_ca_file`` = ``/etc/ssl/cafile/file.ca``
     - (String) Absolute path to the Certificate Authority file.

       Provide a string value representing a valid absolute path to the certificate authority file to use for establishing a secure connection to the registry server.

       NOTE: This option must be set if ``registry_client_protocol`` is set to ``https``. Alternatively, the GLANCE_CLIENT_CA_FILE environment variable may be set to a filepath of the CA file. This option is ignored if the ``registry_client_insecure`` option is set to ``True``.

       Possible values:

       * String value representing a valid absolute path to the CA file.

       Related options:

       * registry_client_protocol

       * registry_client_insecure
   * - ``registry_client_cert_file`` = ``/etc/ssl/certs/file.crt``
     - (String) Absolute path to the certificate file.

       Provide a string value representing a valid absolute path to the certificate file to use for establishing a secure connection to the registry server.

       NOTE: This option must be set if ``registry_client_protocol`` is set to ``https``. Alternatively, the GLANCE_CLIENT_CERT_FILE environment variable may be set to a filepath of the certificate file.

       Possible values:

       * String value representing a valid absolute path to the certificate file.

       Related options:

       * registry_client_protocol
   * - ``registry_client_insecure`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Set verification of the registry server certificate.

       Provide a boolean value to determine whether or not to validate SSL connections to the registry server. By default, this option is set to ``False`` and the SSL connections are validated.

       If set to ``True``, the connection to the registry server is not validated via a certifying authority and the ``registry_client_ca_file`` option is ignored. This is the registry's equivalent of specifying --insecure on the command line using glanceclient for the API.

       Possible values:

       * True

       * False

       Related options:

       * registry_client_protocol

       * registry_client_ca_file
   * - ``registry_client_key_file`` = ``/etc/ssl/key/key-file.pem``
     - (String) Absolute path to the private key file.

       Provide a string value representing a valid absolute path to the private key file to use for establishing a secure connection to the registry server.

       NOTE: This option must be set if ``registry_client_protocol`` is set to ``https``. Alternatively, the GLANCE_CLIENT_KEY_FILE environment variable may be set to a filepath of the key file.

       Possible values:

       * String value representing a valid absolute path to the key file.

       Related options:

       * registry_client_protocol
   * - ``registry_client_protocol`` = ``http``
     - (String) Protocol to use for communication with the registry server.

       Provide a string value representing the protocol to use for communication with the registry server. By default, this option is set to ``http`` and the connection is not secure.

       This option can be set to ``https`` to establish a secure connection to the registry server. In this case, provide a key to use for the SSL connection using the ``registry_client_key_file`` option. Also include the CA file and cert file using the options ``registry_client_ca_file`` and ``registry_client_cert_file`` respectively.

       Possible values:

       * http

       * https

       Related options:

       * registry_client_key_file

       * registry_client_cert_file

       * registry_client_ca_file
   * - ``registry_client_timeout`` = ``600``
     - (Integer) Timeout value for registry requests.

       Provide an integer value representing the period of time in seconds that the API server will wait for a registry request to complete. The default value is 600 seconds.

       A value of 0 implies that a request will never timeout.
