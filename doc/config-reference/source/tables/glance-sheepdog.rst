.. list-table:: Description of Sheepdog configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[glance_store]**
     -
   * - ``sheepdog_store_address`` = ``127.0.0.1``
     - (String) Address to bind the Sheepdog daemon to.

       Provide a string value representing the address to bind the Sheepdog daemon to. The default address set for the 'sheep' is 127.0.0.1.

       The Sheepdog daemon, also called 'sheep', manages the storage in the distributed cluster by writing objects across the storage network. It identifies and acts on the messages directed to the address set using ``sheepdog_store_address`` option to store chunks of Glance images.

       Possible values:

       * A valid IPv4 address

       * A valid IPv6 address

       * A valid hostname

       Related Options:

       * sheepdog_store_port
   * - ``sheepdog_store_chunk_size`` = ``64``
     - (Integer) Chunk size for images to be stored in Sheepdog data store.

       Provide an integer value representing the size in mebibyte (1048576 bytes) to chunk Glance images into. The default chunk size is 64 mebibytes.

       When using Sheepdog distributed storage system, the images are chunked into objects of this size and then stored across the distributed data store to use for Glance.

       Chunk sizes, if a power of two, help avoid fragmentation and enable improved performance.

       Possible values:

       * Positive integer value representing size in mebibytes.

       Related Options:

       * None
   * - ``sheepdog_store_port`` = ``7000``
     - (Port number) Port number on which the sheep daemon will listen.

       Provide an integer value representing a valid port number on which you want the Sheepdog daemon to listen on. The default port is 7000.

       The Sheepdog daemon, also called 'sheep', manages the storage in the distributed cluster by writing objects across the storage network. It identifies and acts on the messages it receives on the port number set using ``sheepdog_store_port`` option to store chunks of Glance images.

       Possible values:

       * A valid port number (0 to 65535)
