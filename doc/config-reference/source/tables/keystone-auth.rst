.. list-table:: Description of authorization configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[auth]**
     -
   * - ``methods`` = ``external, password, token, oauth1, mapped``
     - (List) Allowed authentication methods. Note: You should disable the `external` auth method if you are currently using federation. External auth and federation both use the REMOTE_USER variable. Since both the mapped and external plugin are being invoked to validate attributes in the request environment, it can cause conflicts.
   * - ``password`` = ``None``
     - (String) Entry point for the password auth plugin module in the `keystone.auth.password` namespace. You do not need to set this unless you are overriding keystone's own password authentication plugin.
   * - ``token`` = ``None``
     - (String) Entry point for the token auth plugin module in the `keystone.auth.token` namespace. You do not need to set this unless you are overriding keystone's own token authentication plugin.
   * - ``external`` = ``None``
     - (String) Entry point for the external (`REMOTE_USER`) auth plugin module in the `keystone.auth.external` namespace. Supplied drivers are `DefaultDomain` and `Domain`. The default driver is `DefaultDomain`, which assumes that all users identified by the username specified to keystone in the `REMOTE_USER` variable exist within the context of the default domain. The `Domain` option expects an additional environment variable be presented to keystone, `REMOTE_DOMAIN`, containing the domain name of the `REMOTE_USER` (if `REMOTE_DOMAIN` is not set, then the default domain will be used instead). You do not need to set this unless you are taking advantage of "external authentication", where the application server (such as Apache) is handling authentication instead of keystone.
   * - ``oauth1`` = ``None``
     - (String) Entry point for the OAuth 1.0a auth plugin module in the `keystone.auth.oauth1` namespace. You do not need to set this unless you are overriding keystone's own `oauth1` authentication plugin.
   * - ``mapped`` = ``None``
     - (String) Entry point for the mapped auth plugin module in the `keystone.auth.mapped` namespace. You do not need to set this unless you are overriding keystone's own `mapped` authentication plugin.
