.. list-table:: Description of L3 agent configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``enable_snat_by_default`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Define the default value of enable_snat if not provided in external_gateway_info.
   * - ``external_network_bridge`` =
     - (String) DEPRECATED: Name of bridge used for external network traffic. When this parameter is set, the L3 agent will plug an interface directly into an external bridge which will not allow any wiring by the L2 agent. Using this will result in incorrect port statuses. This option is deprecated and will be removed in Ocata.
   * - ``ha_confs_path`` = ``$state_path/ha_confs``
     - (String) Location to store keepalived/conntrackd config files
   * - ``ha_vrrp_advert_int`` = ``2``
     - (Integer) The advertisement interval in seconds
   * - ``ha_vrrp_auth_password`` = ``None``
     - (String) VRRP authentication password
   * - ``ha_vrrp_auth_type`` = ``PASS``
     - (String) VRRP authentication type
   * - ``host`` = ``example.domain``
     - (String) Hostname to be used by the Neutron server, agents and services running on this machine. All the agents and services running on this machine must use the same host value.
   * - ``interface_driver`` = ``None``
     - (String) The driver used to manage the virtual interface.
   * - ``ipv6_pd_enabled`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Enables IPv6 Prefix Delegation for automatic subnet CIDR allocation. Set to True to enable IPv6 Prefix Delegation for subnet allocation in a PD-capable environment. Users making subnet creation requests for IPv6 subnets without providing a CIDR or subnetpool ID will be given a CIDR via the Prefix Delegation mechanism. Note that enabling PD will override the behavior of the default IPv6 subnetpool.
   * - ``l3_ha`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Enable HA mode for virtual routers.
   * - ``l3_ha_net_cidr`` = ``169.254.192.0/18``
     - (String) Subnet used for the l3 HA admin network.
   * - ``l3_ha_network_physical_name`` =
     - (String) The physical network name with which the HA network can be created.
   * - ``l3_ha_network_type`` =
     - (String) The network type to use when creating the HA network for an HA router. By default or if empty, the first 'tenant_network_types' is used. This is helpful when the VRRP traffic should use a specific network which is not the default one.
   * - ``max_l3_agents_per_router`` = ``3``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of L3 agents which a HA router will be scheduled on. If it is set to 0 then the router will be scheduled on every agent.
   * - ``min_l3_agents_per_router`` = ``2``
     - (Integer) DEPRECATED: Minimum number of L3 agents that have to be available in order to allow a new HA router to be scheduled. This option is deprecated in the Newton release and will be removed for the Ocata release where the scheduling of new HA routers will always be allowed.
   * - **[AGENT]**
     -
   * - ``comment_iptables_rules`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Add comments to iptables rules. Set to false to disallow the addition of comments to generated iptables rules that describe each rule's purpose. System must support the iptables comments module for addition of comments.
   * - ``use_helper_for_ns_read`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Use the root helper when listing the namespaces on a system. This may not be required depending on the security configuration. If the root helper is not required, set this to False for a performance improvement.
