.. list-table:: Description of remote_debug configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

   * - ``host`` = ``None``

     - (String) Debug host (IP or name) to connect to. This command line parameter is used when you want to connect to a nova service via a debugger running on a different host.

       Note that using the remote debug option changes how Nova uses the eventlet library to support async IO. This could result in failures that do not occur under normal operation. Use at your own risk.

       Possible Values:

       * IP address of a remote host as a command line parameter to a nova service. For Example:

        /usr/local/bin/nova-compute --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf --remote_debug-host <IP address where the debugger is running>

   * - ``port`` = ``None``

     - (Port number) Debug port to connect to. This command line parameter allows you to specify the port you want to use to connect to a nova service via a debugger running on different host.

       Note that using the remote debug option changes how Nova uses the eventlet library to support async IO. This could result in failures that do not occur under normal operation. Use at your own risk.

       Possible Values:

       * Port number you want to use as a command line parameter to a nova service. For Example:

        /usr/local/bin/nova-compute --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf --remote_debug-host <IP address where the debugger is running> --remote_debug-port <port> it's listening on>.
