   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[SRIOV_NIC]**
     -
   * - ``exclude_devices`` =
     - (List) Comma-separated list of <network_device>:<vfs_to_exclude> tuples, mapping network_device to the agent's node-specific list of virtual functions that should not be used for virtual networking. vfs_to_exclude is a semicolon-separated list of virtual functions to exclude from network_device. The network_device in the mapping should appear in the physical_device_mappings list.
   * - ``physical_device_mappings`` =
     - (List) Comma-separated list of <physical_network>:<network_device> tuples mapping physical network names to the agent's node-specific physical network device interfaces of SR-IOV physical function to be used for VLAN networks. All physical networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the server should have mappings to appropriate interfaces on each agent.
