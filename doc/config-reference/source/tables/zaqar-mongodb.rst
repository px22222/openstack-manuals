.. list-table:: Description of MongoDB configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[drivers:management_store:mongodb]**
     -
   * - ``database`` = ``zaqar``
     - (String) Database name.
   * - ``max_attempts`` = ``1000``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of times to retry a failed operation. Currently only used for retrying a message post.
   * - ``max_reconnect_attempts`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of times to retry an operation that failed due to a primary node failover.
   * - ``max_retry_jitter`` = ``0.005``
     - (Floating point) Maximum jitter interval, to be added to the sleep interval, in order to decrease probability that parallel requests will retry at the same instant.
   * - ``max_retry_sleep`` = ``0.1``
     - (Floating point) Maximum sleep interval between retries (actual sleep time increases linearly according to number of attempts performed).
   * - ``reconnect_sleep`` = ``0.02``
     - (Floating point) Base sleep interval between attempts to reconnect after a primary node failover. The actual sleep time increases exponentially (power of 2) each time the operation is retried.
   * - ``ssl_ca_certs`` = ``None``
     - (String) The ca_certs file contains a set of concatenated "certification authority" certificates, which are used to validate certificates passed from the other end of the connection.
   * - ``ssl_cert_reqs`` = ``CERT_REQUIRED``
     - (String) Specifies whether a certificate is required from the other side of the connection, and whether it will be validated if provided. It must be one of the three values ``CERT_NONE``(certificates ignored), ``CERT_OPTIONAL``(not required, but validated if provided), or ``CERT_REQUIRED``(required and validated). If the value of this parameter is not ``CERT_NONE``, then the ``ssl_ca_cert`` parameter must point to a file of CA certificates.
   * - ``ssl_certfile`` = ``None``
     - (String) The certificate file used to identify the local connection against mongod.
   * - ``ssl_keyfile`` = ``None``
     - (String) The private keyfile used to identify the local connection against mongod. If included with the ``certifle`` then only the ``ssl_certfile`` is needed.
   * - ``uri`` = ``None``
     - (String) Mongodb Connection URI. If ssl connection enabled, then ``ssl_keyfile``, ``ssl_certfile``, ``ssl_cert_reqs``, ``ssl_ca_certs`` need to be set accordingly.
   * - **[drivers:message_store:mongodb]**
     -
   * - ``database`` = ``zaqar``
     - (String) Database name.
   * - ``max_attempts`` = ``1000``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of times to retry a failed operation. Currently only used for retrying a message post.
   * - ``max_reconnect_attempts`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of times to retry an operation that failed due to a primary node failover.
   * - ``max_retry_jitter`` = ``0.005``
     - (Floating point) Maximum jitter interval, to be added to the sleep interval, in order to decrease probability that parallel requests will retry at the same instant.
   * - ``max_retry_sleep`` = ``0.1``
     - (Floating point) Maximum sleep interval between retries (actual sleep time increases linearly according to number of attempts performed).
   * - ``partitions`` = ``2``
     - (Integer) Number of databases across which to partition message data, in order to reduce writer lock %. DO NOT change this setting after initial deployment. It MUST remain static. Also, you should not need a large number of partitions to improve performance, esp. if deploying MongoDB on SSD storage.
   * - ``reconnect_sleep`` = ``0.02``
     - (Floating point) Base sleep interval between attempts to reconnect after a primary node failover. The actual sleep time increases exponentially (power of 2) each time the operation is retried.
   * - ``ssl_ca_certs`` = ``None``
     - (String) The ca_certs file contains a set of concatenated "certification authority" certificates, which are used to validate certificates passed from the other end of the connection.
   * - ``ssl_cert_reqs`` = ``CERT_REQUIRED``
     - (String) Specifies whether a certificate is required from the other side of the connection, and whether it will be validated if provided. It must be one of the three values ``CERT_NONE``(certificates ignored), ``CERT_OPTIONAL``(not required, but validated if provided), or ``CERT_REQUIRED``(required and validated).

     - (String) The private keyfile used to identify the local connection against mongod. If included with the ``certifle`` then only the ``ssl_certfile`` is needed.
   * - ``uri`` = ``None``
     - (String) Mongodb Connection URI. If ssl connection enabled, then ``ssl_keyfile``, ``ssl_certfile``, ``ssl_cert_reqs``, ``ssl_ca_certs`` need to be set accordingly.
