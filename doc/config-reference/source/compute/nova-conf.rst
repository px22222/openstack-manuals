Overview of nova.conf
=====================

The ``nova.conf`` configuration file is an
`INI file format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_
as explained in :doc:`../config-format`.

You can use a particular configuration option file by using the ``option``
(``nova.conf``) parameter when you run one of the ``nova-*`` services.
This parameter inserts configuration option definitions from the
specified configuration file name, which might be useful for debugging
or performance tuning.

For a list of configuration options, see the tables in this guide.

.. important::

   Do not specify quotes around nova options.
