Scripts overview
================

This section provides an overview of scripts used by the OpenStack
documentation project grouped by repositories they are stored in.


openstack-doc-tools repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

autogenerate_config_docs
  Generates configuration references published at
  https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/.

build_environment directory (deprecated)
  A Vagrant environment for working with the guides.

cleanup directory
  Manually cleans up documentation files.

sitemap
  Generates the ``sitemap.xml`` file.

bin
  Contains scripts for building documents in the ``openstack-manuals``
  repository. Used inside the tox environments.

os_doc_tools directory
----------------------

openstack-autohelp
  A helper script run from the git repository by ``autogenerate_config_docs``.

openstack-auto-commands
  Generates the command-line interface reference published at
  https://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/. A helper script to use this
  tool is available at ``bin/doc-tools-update-cli-reference``.

openstack-jsoncheck
  Checks JSON files. Used for the API guides.


openstack-manuals repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several scripts currently reside in the `openstack-manuals
<https://github.com/openstack/openstack-manuals>`_ repository. It may be
beneficial to consolidate these into the ``openstack-doc-tools`` repository.

www-generator.py
  Generates static, template-based HTML files for
  https://docs.openstack.org/. The script reads YAML data files in
  ``www/project-data`` to determine which projects exist in a given
  series and how they should be displayed on the list of installation,
  configuration, and other guides. The file
  ``www/project-data/schema.yaml`` contains the JSONSchema settings to
  describe what a valid data file looks like.

sync-projects.sh
  Synchronizes the **Glossary**, common files, and some translations
  across multiple repositories, including ``api-site`` and ``security-doc``.

publishdocs.sh
  Publishdocs job uses this script to publish documentation to
  https://docs.openstack.org/.


Notes
~~~~~

- ``openstack-doc-tools`` must be released so it can be pinned in requirements
  files, enabling automation to work across repositories.

- There are many undocumented synchronizations (automated and manual) between
  the various documentation repositories. These should be documented.

- There are a several jobs that must be run regularly, for example, updating
  the ``sitemap.xml`` file and the command line configuration reference. These
  should be documented.

- Some manual jobs should be automated. For example, the ``sitemap.xml`` file
  should be automatically updated by the Gerritbot.
