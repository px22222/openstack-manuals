OpenStack documentation is treated in the same way as code, and follows the
standard code review process. To see what documentation changes are ready for
review, use the `Documentation Program Dashboard
<http://is.gd/openstackdocsreview>`_. It is organized in groups based on the
audience for the documentation. To see current proposed changes, make sure
you register and log into https://review.openstack.org. For more details on
the review process, see `Code Review
<https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#code-review>`_.

Repositories and core team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack Documentation team is core for the api-site, openstack-manuals,
openstackdocstheme, and openstack-doc-tools projects.

For the following repositories that are part of the Documentation program,
special rules apply:

* docs-specs: has a separate core team,
  see :doc:`docs-specs <blueprints-and-specs>` section.
* security-doc: has a separate core team consisting of Docs team members and
  Security team members. The rule here is that each patch needs an approval
  by a Docs core and a Security core.
* training-guides and training-labs: have separate core teams, but also
  includes the openstack-manuals core team.

The current list of docs cores for openstack-manuals can be found at
`Group openstack-doc-core
<https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/30,members>`_.

Reviewing a documentation patch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you proceed with reviewing patches, make sure to read carefully
the :doc:`Review Guidelines <docs-review-guidelines>` for documentation
and `Code Review Guidelines
<https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#code-review>`_.
Once done, follow the steps below to submit a patch review.

#. Go to the `Documentation Program Dashboard
   <http://is.gd/openstackdocsreview>`_.
#. Select a patch set.
#. Click a file that was uploaded to view the changes side by side.
#. If you see some inconsistencies or have questions to the patch owner,
   you can also highlight the line or word in question, and press 'c'
   on your keyboard, which enables commenting directly on that line or word.
   Click :guilabel:`Save` button once you write a draft of your comment.
#. In the :guilabel:`Jenkins check` section, click the ``checkbuild``
   gate link (for the openstack-manuals, it is called
   ``gate-openstack-manuals-tox-doc-publish-checkbuild``) and review the
   built manuals to see how the change will look on the web page. For a new
   patch, it takes some time before the OpenStack CI system checks appear on
   the Gerrit page.
   You can also :ref:`build the patch locally <docs_builds_locally>`
   if necessary.
#. Click :guilabel:`Reply` to vote and enter any comments about your review,
   then click :guilabel:`Post`.

.. note::

   A patch with WorkInProgress (WIP) status needs additional work
   before review and possible approval. Therefore, you may skip such a patch
   and review once it is ready. For more information, see `Work In Progress
   <https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/core.html#work-in-progress>`_.

Achieving core reviewer status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Core reviewers are able to +2 and merge content into the projects they
have core status in. Core status is granted to those who have not
only done a sufficient quantity of reviews, but who also have shown care
and wisdom in those reviews.

The core reviewer's role is complex, and having a great core team is crucial
to the success of any OpenStack project. The documentation team aims to have
a suitably small team of core reviewers, with each core reviewer being active
and engaged. The process for appointing core reviewers aims to ensure there
is a good mix between a statistics-based and nomination-based approach. To
this end, the core team changes relatively quickly, with inactive core team
members being removed and new, active core team members being added on a
regular basis. This also allows the existing core team to act quickly on
recognizing valuable team members.

The process is:

* Every month (usually on the 1st), the documentation PTL draws the top 12
  names using these reports:

  * `Reviews for the last 30 days
    <http://russellbryant.net/openstack-stats/docs-reviewers-30.txt>`_
  * `Reviews for the last 90 days
    <http://russellbryant.net/openstack-stats/docs-reviewers-90.txt>`_
  * `Openstack Manuals stackalytics
    <http://stackalytics.com/?module=openstack-manuals&metric=commits>`_

* The PTL then consults the existing core team with a list of names to be
  removed from and added to the core list. Once an agreement is reached,
  the changes are made and advertised to the main documentation mailing list.
  Cores who are being added or removed will be contacted personally before
  changes are made.

* Existing core team members can nominate a new core member at any time,
  with a justification sent to the existing core team:
  openstack-doc-core@lists.launchpad.net. Three +1 votes from other existing
  core team members must be achieved for approval.

Core reviewer responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Becoming a core reviewer carries with it a responsibility: you are now the
guardian of the gate, and it is up to the core team to ensure that nothing
unfavorable gets through, without discouraging contributions.

General instructions for being a core reviewer are located in the
`Core Reviewer's Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#code-review>`_.
This section is for openstack-manuals core reviewers.

In almost all cases, patches can be merged with at least one +1 vote, and
two +2 votes. The second +2 vote is usually the one that will also merge the
patch (often referred to as a +2A vote). There are very few exceptions to
this rule within documentation, the main one being extraordinary
circumstances where a patch has broken the build and a fix is required very
quickly. In this case, you should still seek out another core team member
if possible, and make some kind of contact with the PTL so that they are
aware of the problem.

If you are a core team member, but don't feel you understand the subject
matter of a patch well enough to confidently merge it, vote +1 and mention
your reasons. Being overly cautious is better than being overly confident.

Try not to merge a patch too quickly, even if it strictly has the correct
number of votes. Allowing a patch to sit for a couple of days is generally
helpful, in order to ensure enough people have seen the change. It can also
be valuable to add speciality team leads or other subject matter experts
to patches where you feel more specialized knowledge is required to make
a good decision.

A note on review rigor: There are very few guidelines about what a good patch
looks like, but the general approach is that if it's technically accurate and
better than the existing content, then it should be approved. The main things
to look for:

* General spelling and grammar.
* Technical accuracy. Where possible, test commands on your own VM to make
  sure they're accurate. Check any related bugs and mailing list conversation
  to see if there's anything else you might need to take into account.
* The 'is it better than what we have already' test. Check the diff, or look
  at the current document on the doc site, and determine if the changes are
  an improvement. Provide corrections in-line for the author to fix if
  there's more than a couple of errors. If there's just one or two really
  minor changes (or in a situation where the writer has explicitly asked for
  editorial assistance), consider checking out the patch and editing it
  yourself.

And, as a final note: Be nice. Be helpful. It is your job as a core reviewer
to help people get patches merged, not block them.
