OpenStack documentation uses reStructuredText (RST) markup syntax
with Sphinx extensions.

RST is a powerful and straightforward markup language that, in combination
with Sphinx, provides a wide range of facilities for intelligent and
appealing documentation creation. It uses simple and implicit
syntax to introduce a variety of content elements such as titles,
code blocks, vertical lists, and many others. All the source content formatted
using RST is stored in files with the ``.rst`` extension.

To keep the documentation format consistent, follow the guidelines
included in this chapter for all the RST source content. When in doubt,
use simpler formatting.

   All the examples provided in this chapter are for illustration purposes
