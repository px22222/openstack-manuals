When you are writing a new feature for a component of OpenStack, it is
important that you also document that new feature.
This is also true if you are adding or changing configuration options,
commands, or other user-facing components.

Many of these types of changes are handled automatically by
``openstack-doc-tools``, and published to the Configuration Reference
and Command-Line Reference. For more information about these automated
tools, see the :ref:`doc-tools` chapter.

If you are contributing documentation to the main openstack-manuals
repository, there are a few things you can do to help your patch merge
quickly and easily:

* Contact your project's documentation `cross-project liaison
  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CrossProjectLiaisons#Documentation>`_.
  They can help you with finding the appropriate book to add your patch, and
  the relevant people to review your patch once you have written it.
* If you are not confident in your written English skills, you can create a
  patch and add a note that you are happy to have editorial assistance.
  This will encourage writers to check out your patch and correct any
  spelling or grammar mistakes, rather than just adding comments for you
  to fix yourself.
* If you do not know which book to edit, or you are uncertain about creating
  a patch, you can create a bug with source content or notes, and ask for
  assistance from the docs team on finding the right location for the content.
* If you know which book you want to modify, get in contact with the
  appropriate speciality team, listed at :doc:`../team-structure`. They
  can help you determine where the content should live, and also give you
  details about upcoming changes to the architecture of those books that
  might affect your new documentation.
* If you are intending to make a very large change, such as an entirely
  new section or chapter, or documenting a new project, the core team might
  ask you to create a blueprint and specification for the change. If you are
  unsure whether your change will require a blueprint or specification, ask
  on the mailing list for guidance.
* If you want to create a new Installation Tutorial for your big tent
  project, see :doc:`../project-install-guide`.
* Remember, you can always contact the documentation team through our mailing
  list, or on IRC.
