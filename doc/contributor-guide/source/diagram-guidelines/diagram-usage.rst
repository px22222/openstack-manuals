======================
Use diagrams sparingly
======================

Diagrams can be useful tools to help orient users visualize complex
processes. However, diagrams can sometimes be too simplistic, confusing
the user instead of helping. The decision about whether a diagram is
useful depends on the context of each project and the discretion
of each contributor and reviewer.

When to use diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include diagrams in OpenStack documentation in the following
situations:

* If there is evidence of a process, whether the process is
  automated or manual

  Example: Basic setup workflow

* If you need to clarify configurations and reference architectures

  Example: Code review, upstream versus local environment


When not to use diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not include diagrams in the following situations:

* When a workflow is too simplistic
* When there is no interaction with an OpenStack project
* When a configuration can be easily explained through text
