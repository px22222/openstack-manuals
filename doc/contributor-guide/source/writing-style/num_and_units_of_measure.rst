Numbers and units of measure
============================

When using numbers in running text, follow these guidelines:

* Spell out numbers from one to nine. However, use numerals for units
  of measure.
* Use Arabic numerals for numbers above ten.
* If a numeral starts a sentence, spell it out. For example: *Five thousand
  environments have been deployed during the last six months.*
* In one sentence, use either a spelled-out number or a numeral, not both.
* Use a comma if a numeral includes more than 4 digits. For example: *50,000*.

In mathematical expressions:

* Use the *x* symbol for multiplication.
* Add a space between numbers and operators. For example: *256 x 2 = 512*.

When using units of measure in running text, follow these guidelines:

* Use the corresponding unit symbol if a unit of measure comes immediately
  after a numeral.

  * **Kb** for kilobit
  * **KB** for kilobyte
  * **kbps** for kilobits per second
  * **GB** for gigabyte
  * **Gbit** for gigabit
  * **MB** for megabyte

* Do not pluralize an abbreviated unit of measure.
* Add a space between a numeral and a unit of measure.
