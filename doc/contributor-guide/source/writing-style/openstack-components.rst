OpenStack service and project names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use uppercase when you refer to a service name. For example, use
*Compute service*, *Image service*, or *Identity service* instead
of *nova*, *glance*, or *keystone*.

Use lowercase when you refer to:

* project names
* project team names
* command-line interface (CLI)

For more information, see `Service and Project Naming
<https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/service-project-naming.html>`_
in OpenStack Technical Committee governance documents.

The official source for services and project names is in the
`projects.yaml <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/governance/tree/reference/projects.yaml>`_
file in the ``openstack/governance`` repository.
