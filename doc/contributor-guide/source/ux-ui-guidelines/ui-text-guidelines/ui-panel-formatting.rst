Workflow navigation text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use default values for page or window title bars,
side navigation, fonts, and text size.
For example, tab titles must be a smaller
text size than the section heading.

Similarly, the node item title must be a smaller
font than the page or window title. If necessary,
you might have to shorten the node item title
in order to maintain the default width.

Icons
~~~~~

Be selective when deciding to use icons instead
of text. It is often difficult for users to
understand the intent of an icon. New icons
should be thoroughly reviewed and tested by
the user experience project. That said, icons
can improve usability in specific instances.

For example:

* You have limited space.
* The icon is quickly recognizable.

  .. note::

     Consider global audiences and whether the
     icon is recognizable across cultural differences.

* The icon enhances design appeal.

If you decide to use an icon, follow these tips:

* Keep the design simple and consistent.
* Keep the location of individual icons
  consistent.
  Users recognize and expect patterns
  which help to establish meaning and function.
* Ensure the icon is quickly recognizable and
  memorable. For help, work with the UX
  project.
* If there is space, consider adding a text
  label to the icon.
