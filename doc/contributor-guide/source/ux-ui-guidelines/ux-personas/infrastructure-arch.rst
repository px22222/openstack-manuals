Adrian - infrastructure architect
=================================

Adrian spends a lot of time reading and researching information about
OpenStack and other cloud technologies. Adrian has attended more than one
OpenStack summit, and contributes solutions to the community regularly. Adrian
values OpenStack and is committed to drive adoption. Adrian's priority,
however, is a fully functional and stable cloud that fulfills all of his
requirements. Your development affects Adrian if it modifies the scope,
implementation, or usage of OpenStack.

Key tasks
~~~~~~~~~

Adrian performs the following tasks very frequently:

* Decision making: Considers adoption of OpenStack based on financial,
  strategic, architecture, and security advantages.

* Hardware configurations: Determines if a hardware configuration
  suits the requirements of a cloud instance and if an OpenStack solution
  running on such hardware is the best possible option.

* User experience: Considers application developers, the development
  processes, and the end users when recommending and installing cloud
  instances.

* Cloud planning: Defines and plans the cloud while considering hardware,
  platform choices, services, and scale.

Your development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adrian's main concern is the cloud's architecture. Adrian interacts directly
with OpenStack and has probably developed many pieces that were needed. Your
development targets Adrian if it makes any changes to the way clouds are
implemented and deployed. Any new features, fixes, and limitations are
important to Adrian.

The reasons that would deter Adrian from recommending OpenStack
are frequent instabilities, non-deterministic errors, the inability to create
an environment, and missing documentation. Similarly to the domain operator,
Adrian needs to know about any outage conditions that may occur on both
testing and production environments.

The organizational models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within a small organization, such as Rifkom or Nikishi University,
Adrian might be required to assume some roles and responsibilities of a
Cloud Operator or, more rarely, a Domain Operator. Within a larger
organization, like CNBB Securities, Adrian's tasks are performed by the
team planning and implementing the cloud instances. See :ref:`model-companies`
for more information on how Adrian fits into different user ecosystems.
