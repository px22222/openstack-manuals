Release task detail
===================

This section provides detailed instructions for each release task.

Installation Tutorial testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process for Installation Tutorial testing begins about six weeks before
release day. First of all, create a new testing page on the wiki, based on
`the previous one
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/NewtonDocTesting>`_.

You will need to locate pre-release packages for each distribution, and
disseminate information about obtaining the packages for testing purposes.
The current list of packaging contacts:

* openSUSE/SLES: Pranav Salunke (dguitarbite)
* RDO/CentOS: Petr Kovar and Haïkel Guémar
* Ubuntu: James Page

As soon as pre-release packages are available, you can start testing. Testers
should look at the current draft version of the document, and attempt to
run each command on the pre-release package. If you are able to run the
instructions in the book successfully, then place a green tick in the
matrix, noting which version you tested against. If a command cannot be run,
and it is confirmed to be a bug in the documentation, add a note in the
`Issues` section, so that the book can be updated.

.. note::

   Testers should avoid raising bugs against the book at this stage, to ensure
   that the fix lands before release. Instead, list the details on the testing
   wiki page, so other testers are aware of it.

It is also important to ask Cross Project Liaisons (CPLs) to check the
chapters or project-specific guides that relate to their projects. It is
possible that changes might have happened within projects during the
release that have not been reflected in the documentation.

As release day draws near, and testing progresses, the PTL will make a
judgment call on whether or not the various Installation Tutorials are
tested sufficiently to be released. In some rare cases, the book either
has not been tested adequately, or has performed badly in tests, which can
justify not publishing that book. In this case, the PTL will contact
relevant parties to let them know of the decision, and work with them to
get the book to an adequate level to be published at some point after
release day.

Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack Manuals no longer handles release notes for the project teams.
However, we do need to write release notes for our documentation. Release
notes should be added as major changes occur throughout the release, however
this is often overlooked - both by authors and reviewers - and thus a final
review is needed to check that all major changes are in. Contact each
Specialty Team lead, listed at :doc:`../team-structure`, and ask them for
the notes for the books they look after. The source repository for release
notes is `openstack-manuals/releasenotes/source/RELEASENAME` and they are
published to
`https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/openstack-manuals/RELEASENAME.html`.

Update www pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make the following changes in the **openstack-manuals** repository:

#. Create the docs.openstack.org index page for the new release, using the
   existing page as a template:

   - ``/www/RELEASE/index.html``

#. Copy the latest project data file to one named for the release:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cp www/project-data/latest.yaml www/project-data/RELEASE.yaml

#. Create the project-install-guide index page for the new release, using the
   existing page as a template:

   - ``/www/project-install-guide/RELEASE/index.html``

#. Modify the new file to set the ``SERIES`` variable for the template
   correctly:

   .. code-block:: jinja

      {% set SERIES = "RELEASE" %}

#. Create the ``project-deploy-guide`` index for the new release, using the
   existing page as a template:

   - ``/www/project-deploy-guide/RELEASE/index.html``

#. Add the new pages to the list in ``/www/www-index.html``.

   This patch should have a core -2 review on it until it is ready to be
   published. This should happen about a week before release day, sending the
   page live, but should remain unlinked until the last moment. This is to
   allow the release team to link to the new page.

#. Update the drop-down menu. Merge this patch on release day:

   - ``/www/templates/dropdown_releases_and_languages.tmpl``

#. Update the site redirects. Merge this patch on release day:

   - ``/www/.htaccess``

#. Update the *Get started* links. Do not merge this patch until after the
   links are active:

   - ``/doc/common/get-started-with-openstack.rst``

Update links in all books
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every book maintained by OpenStack Manuals must be checked for links
referencing the old release. Do one patch per book, and record the review
number in the release etherpad so that release managers can review easily.
For versioned books, these patches should have a core -2 review on them until
they are ready to be published at release time. For continuously released
books, these patches can be merged immediately.

In some versioned guides, the master branch links to draft books in some
locations. Most notably, the basic Installation Tutorial links to the
additional services Installation Guides in
``doc/install-guide/source/additional-services.rst``. Update these links to
the correct version before publishing the book.

Update main docs page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On release day, change the front page so the new release is the default by
synchronising `openstack-manuals/www/RELEASENAME/index.html`, which you
created earlier, with `openstack/openstack-manuals/www/index.html`. These
two files should have the same content.

Merge all the release day patches prepared earlier.

Changes to the docs site can take an hour or more to populate, depending on
the status of the gate and the number of changes being pushed at release time,
so be prepared to have the release day patches ready well ahead of the
official release time. You can check the current gate status at `Zuul status
<http://status.openstack.org/zuul/>`_ to get an idea of the current merge
times.

Generate the site map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the release day patches have merged, generate a new site map for
docs.openstack.org using the ``sitemap`` script in the **openstack-doc-tools**
repository. Copy the `sitemap.xml` file into the `www/static` directory in
the **openstack-manuals** repository and commit the change.

Cut the branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cut the branch for versioned guides. This usually happens about a month
after release day, but the timing is informed mainly by the volume of
changes going in to the guides. Cutting the branch is done by the
OpenStack Infrastructure team.

Once the branch ``stable/RELEASENAME`` is created, a few things need
to be set up before any other changes merge:

* Update the ``stable/RELEASENAME`` branch (`example stable branch change
  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/396875/>`__):

  * Disable all non-translated and non-versioned guides for
    translation.
  * Only build backported guides (install-guide, config-reference,
    networking-guide).
  * Publish backported guides and their translations to
    ``/RELEASENAME/``.
  * Do not publish web pages.
  * Update ``.gitreview`` for the branch.

* Update the ``master`` branch (`example master branch change
  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/396874/>`__):

  * Do not copy content anymore to ``/RELEASENAME``.
  * Update the sphinxmark configuration files for versioned guides
    with the latest release name.


Also, for translations the following needs to be done:

* The translation server needs be set up for this. A version
  ``stable-RELEASENAME`` needs to be set up as copy from ``master``.
* The OpenStack CI set up needs to be adjusted for the branch. Change
  in ``openstack-infra/project-config`` the gerritbot notifications and
  the import of translations (`example infra change
  <https://review.openstack.org/396876>`__).

End-of-life
~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a release is at end-of-life, you must stop producing new publications.
To indicate the end-of-life, add the below sentence at the index
for release-specific documentation:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. warning::

      This guide documents the OpenStack Liberty release and is frozen
      as OpenStack Liberty has reached its official end-of-life.
      This guide will not get any updates from the OpenStack project anymore.
      See the `OpenStack Documentation page
      <https://docs.openstack.org/>`_ for current documentation.

For continuously released documentation, exclude the release from target.

For example, from:

.. code-block:: rst

   This guide documents OpenStack Newton, Mitaka, and Liberty releases.

To:

.. code-block:: rst

   This guide documents OpenStack Newton and Mitaka releases.

However, we will keep the documentation on the
`docs.openstack.org <https://docs.openstack.org/>`_
page for a while so that the users can refer the guides if necessary.
