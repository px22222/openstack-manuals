Releasing tools
===============

The ``openstackdocstheme``, ``openstack-doc-tools``, and
``os-api-ref`` repositories need to be released as packages to the
`Python Packaging Index <http://pypi.python.org>`__.

The release is done by the OpenStack release team but needs to be triggered by
the documentation team. For details, see `Release management
<https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/release-management.html#how-to-release>`_.
For the steps required to trigger a release, see the openstack/releases `README
<https://github.com/openstack/releases/blob/master/README.rst>`_ file.
