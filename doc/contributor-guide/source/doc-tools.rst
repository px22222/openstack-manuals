=========================
Using documentation tools
=========================

The OpenStack documentation toolkit includes a number of scripts used
for performing automated tasks to maintain the OpenStack documentation
project. For example, there are tools that generate configuration and
command-line interface references, generate a sitemap, check niceness,
synchronize files used across multiple repositories, and others.

This section provides an overview of the documentation tools and their
location, explains how to install, configure, use, and contribute to them.
