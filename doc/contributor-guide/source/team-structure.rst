Documentation team structure
============================

The Documentation project provides documentation for various OpenStack
projects to promote OpenStack, develop and maintain tools and processes
to ensure quality and accuracy of documentation.

The OpenStack community has the following documentation specialty teams
with their respective leads:

* :doc:`API <api-guides>`: Anne Gentle
* `Security Guide
  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/SecurityGuide>`_:
  Nathaniel Dillon
* `Training Guides <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Training-guides>`_:
  Matjaz Pancur
* `Training labs
  <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/training-labs>`_:
  Pranav Salunke, Roger Luethi

The current list of docs cores for openstack-manuals, openstackdocstheme,
and openstack-doc-tools repositories can be found at
https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/30,members.
The docs-specs, security-doc, training-guides, and training-labs
repositories have separate core teams.

The cross-project liaisons (CPLs) assist with subject matter questions,
reviews, doc bug triaging, and patching docs.
Refer to `documentation cross-project liaisons
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CrossProjectLiaisons#Documentation>`_
for the list of people, and if you are interested in becoming a CPL
