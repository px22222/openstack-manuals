SQL database
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most OpenStack services use an SQL database to store information. The
database typically runs on the controller node. The procedures in this
guide use MariaDB or MySQL depending on the distribution. OpenStack
services also support other SQL databases including
`PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`__.
