Why and how we wrote this book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We wrote this book to guide you through designing an OpenStack cloud
architecture. This guide identifies design considerations for common
cloud use cases and provides examples.

The Architecture Design Guide was written in a book sprint format, which
is a facilitated, rapid development production method for books. The
Book Sprint was facilitated by Faith Bosworth and Adam Hyde of Book
Sprints, for more information, see the Book Sprints website
(www.booksprints.net).

This book was written in five days during July 2014 while exhausting the
M&M, Mountain Dew and healthy options supply, complete with juggling
entertainment during lunches at VMware's headquarters in Palo Alto.

We would like to thank VMware for their generous hospitality, as well as
our employers, Cisco, Cloudscaling, Comcast, EMC, Mirantis, Rackspace,
Red Hat, Verizon, and VMware, for enabling us to contribute our time. We
would especially like to thank Anne Gentle and Kenneth Hui for all of
their shepherding and organization in making this happen.
