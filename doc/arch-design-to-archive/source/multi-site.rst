OpenStack is capable of running in a multi-region configuration. This
enables some parts of OpenStack to effectively manage a group of sites
as a single cloud.

Some use cases that might indicate a need for a multi-site deployment of
OpenStack include:

*  An organization with a diverse geographic footprint.

*  Geo-location sensitive data.

*  Data locality, in which specific data or functionality should be
   close to users.
