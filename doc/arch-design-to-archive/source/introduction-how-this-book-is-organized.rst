How this book is organized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This book examines some of the most common uses for OpenStack clouds,
and explains the considerations for each use case. Cloud architects may
use this book as a comprehensive guide by reading all of the use cases,
but it is also possible to review only the chapters which pertain to a
specific use case. The use cases covered in this guide include:

*  :doc:`General purpose<generalpurpose>`: Uses common components that
   address 80% of common use cases.

*  :doc:`Compute focused<compute-focus>`: For compute intensive workloads
   such as high performance computing (HPC).

*  :doc:`Storage focused<storage-focus>`: For storage intensive workloads
   such as data analytics with parallel file systems.

*  :doc:`Network focused<network-focus>`: For high performance and
   reliable networking, such as a :term:`content delivery network (CDN)`.

*  :doc:`Multi-site<multi-site>`: For applications that require multiple
   site deployments for geographical, reliability or data locality
   reasons.

*  :doc:`Hybrid cloud<hybrid>`: Uses multiple disparate clouds connected
   either for failover, hybrid cloud bursting, or availability.

*  :doc:`Massively scalable<massively-scalable>`: For cloud service
   providers or other large installations.

*  :doc:`Specialized cases<specialized>`: Architectures that have not
   previously been covered in the defined use cases.
