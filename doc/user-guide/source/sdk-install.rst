Installing OpenStack SDK
-------------------------

Each OpenStack project has its own Python library. These libraries are
bundled with the command-line clients. For example, the Python bindings
for the Compute API are bundled with the python-novaclient package.

For details about how to install the clients, see
:doc:`../common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients`.
