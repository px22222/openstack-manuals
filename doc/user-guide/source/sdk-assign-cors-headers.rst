Assign CORS headers to requests
===============================

:term:`Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)` is a specification that
defines how browsers and servers communicate across origins by using
HTTP headers, such as those assigned by Object Storage API
requests. The Object Storage API supports the following headers:

- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin
- Access-Control-Expose-Headers
- Access-Control-Max-Age
- Access-Control-Request-Headers
- Access-Control-Request-Method
- Origin

You can only assign these headers to objects. For more information, see
`www.w3.org/TR/access-control/ <http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/>`__.

This example assigns the file origin to the ``Origin`` header, which
ensures that the file originated from a reputable source.
