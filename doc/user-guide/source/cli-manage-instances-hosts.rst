==========================
Manage instances and hosts
==========================

Instances are virtual machines that run inside the cloud on physical
compute nodes. The Compute service manages instances. A host is the node
on which a group of instances resides.

This section describes how to perform the different tasks involved in
instance management, such as adding floating IP addresses, stopping and
starting instances, and terminating instances. This section also
discusses node management tasks.
