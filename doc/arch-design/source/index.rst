.. note::

   This guide is a work in progress. Contributions are welcome.

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The Architecture Design Guide provides information on planning and designing
an OpenStack cloud. It explains core concepts, cloud architecture design
requirements, and the design criteria of key components and services in an
OpenStack cloud. The guide also describes five common cloud use cases.

Before reading this book, we recommend:

* Prior knowledge of cloud architecture and principles.
* Linux and virtualization experience.
* A basic understanding of networking principles and protocols.

For information about deploying and operating OpenStack, see the
`Installation Tutorials and Guides <https://docs.openstack.org/project-install-guide/ocata/>`_,
`Deployment Guides <https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/ocata/>`_,
and the `OpenStack Operations Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/ops-guide/>`_.
