Get images
==========

The simplest way to obtain a virtual machine image that works with
OpenStack is to download one that someone else has already
created. Most of the images contain the ``cloud-init`` package to
support the SSH key pair and user data injection.
Because many of the images disable SSH password authentication
by default, boot the image with an injected key pair.
You can ``SSH`` into the instance with the private key and default
login account. See the `OpenStack End User Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/configure-access-and-security-for-instances.html>`_
for more information on how to create and inject key pairs with OpenStack.

If your deployment uses QEMU or KVM, we recommend using the images
in qcow2 format. The most recent 64-bit qcow2 image as of this
writing is `cirros-0.3.5-x86_64-disk.img
<http://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.5/cirros-0.3.5-x86_64-disk.img>`_.
