    # For each of the following sections, add any changes relating
    # to that section, or remove the section altogether if there
    # are no changes relating to it.
    #
    # All of the list items in each of the following sections are
    # combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text needs
    # to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    # available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean
    # repeating some details.
    #
    # If the relevant section is missing from the below list, please
    # first submit a review adding it to releasenotes/config.yaml.
    # This way we can ensure that we have a consistent set of sections
    # without any duplication.
    prelude: >
        Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the
        section for this release. Not every release note requires a
        prelude. Usually only notes describing major features or
        adding release theme details should have a prelude.
