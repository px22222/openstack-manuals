  now includes Container Infrastructure Management service (magnum),
  Messaging service (zaqar), Key Manager service (barbican), and Bare Metal
  service (ironic).

  such as database connections and RPC messaging.

  and search engine optimization.

Internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  transition to RST, and the old DocBook tools have been retired.

  ha-guide has been moved into the openstack-manuals repository. The
  operations-guide and ha-guide repositories have been retired.

API guides
~~~~~~~~~~

  repository to project specific repositories. The collection of API docs
  is now available on the `OpenStack API Documentation <https://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/quick-start/>`_.

* The `Compute API <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/>`_ and
  `DNS API <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/dns/>`__ sites offer great
  examples of the new API reference, maintained by the project team rather
  than a central docs team.

* Updated the `Contributor Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/api-guides.html>`__
  to include specific API Guides information.

* Completed `API Documentation <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-wg/guidelines/api-docs.html>`__
  guidelines with the API Working Group.

  and Bare Metal service (ironic).

* Created `cookiecutter <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/installguide-cookiecutter/>`_
  tool to ensure project specific guides have a consistent structure.

Networking guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Completely restructured the guide.

* Reorganized and rewrote the deployment examples using "building blocks" to
  improve usability and understanding. After choosing either the Linux bridge
  or Open vSwitch mechanism driver, the audience can deploy increasingly
  complex architectures that build on prior simpler examples. Also reduced
  duplication of content.

* Added service subnets.

* Added service function chaining.

* Added RBAC.

* Added address scopes.

* Added BGP dynamic routing.

* Added DPDK for Open vSwitch.

* Improved security groups.

Operations guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Completed RST conversion.

* Added enterprise operations documentation including RabbitMQ troubleshooting
  information, instructions to retrieve lost IP addresses, and procedures to
  manage floating IP addresses between instances.

* Removed instructions to install DevStack and information on contributing
  to OpenStack, which is documented on the DevStack project website and
  Infrastructure Manual respectively.

* Added build tools so that the Security Guide can be built both separately
  and with the OSSN and TA sections.

* Updated glossary terms for Nginx, SPICE, Data Loss Prevention (DLP),
  Trusted Platform Module (TPM), Secure Boot, and other acronyms.

Training guides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improved and restructured `Upstream Training <https://docs.openstack.org/upstream-training/>`_
* Added new chapters in the draft `Training guides <https://docs.openstack.org/draft/training-guides/>`_

Training labs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Training labs landing page is published under `docs.openstack.org <https://docs.openstack.org/training_labs/>`_:

  * Users can download zip/tar files for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X platforms
    for supported releases.

* PXE feature for training-labs:

  * PXE booting functionality is available as a pluggable driver in parallel
    with KVM/VirtualBox.
  * PXE boot could also be used as a mechanism for provisioning KVM/VirtualBox
    based workloads.

* Stability improvements:

  * Various stability improvements have been added in this release.
  * Windows platform support has been updated and improved.
  * Training cluster should additionally have higher deployment rate.
  * Improvements in networking related challenges.

* Performance improvements:

  * Cluster setup speed is improving after addition of multiple features.
  * KVM/Libvirt backends now use shared storage. Hard disks for the cluster
    are diffs on top of the base disk. This uses less storage space.
  * Block storage (cinder) has a dedicated disk as opposed to being file
    mounted as a loop device. This should improve performance and provide
    persistence for cinder-volumes across reboots.
  * Performance improvements by fixing race conditions occurring due
    to virtualization overhead.
  * Improvements to the library scripts.

* Test coverage:

  * Added more tests to ``repeat_test`` scripts.
  * User interface test cases to check the availability of horizon have
    been implemented.

* Updates for supporting new operating systems. For example, Ubuntu 16.04.
* Adds support for x86/i386 architecture.
* Updates to the CLI along with many improvements to address new features.
* Newton support:

  * Newton support should be available shortly after the OpenStack release.
  * This delay is intentional, to let the distribution packages stabilize,
    and to ensure all test cases and reliability checks meet certain criteria.

User guides
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added Redis replication information and Rootwrap Daemon configuration
  information to the Administrator Guide.

* Reorganized the Administrator Guide Telemetry chapter to improve
  information architecture.

* Migrated content on configuring and customizing the Dashboard, previously

  of the Administrator Guide.
